ToricCollisionSystem  is a code package designed to handle 2D toroidal collisions. Instead of using a classic infinite plane, the collision map is toroidalâ€”meaning the left and right edges are connected, as are the top and bottom.

The system supports most common 2D shapes:
- Line
- Ray
- Circle
- Hitbox
- Capsule
- Polygon

This package handles:
- Point overlapping
- Collision detection
- Raycasting
- Collider casting
